## 1. Overview
When it comes to getting a personal domain there are two types of domain provider:

### Free
Free domain registrars exist but typically with significant limitations or control over your personal domain. You'll have limited choice of domains if opting to go with a free registrar which doesn't include any of the most popular or memorable top-level domains (TLD) like <code>.com</code>.

### Paid-for
The best option for most will be a paid-for personal domain which you have complete control over and can opt to transfer to another registrar if you want to. There are many domain registrars to choose from so it’s really just a case of comparing costs and packages that might include other things like hosting, SSL certificates and general support if you need help setting one up.
