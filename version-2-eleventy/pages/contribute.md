**Your contribution to IndieWeb Guides is encouraged but firstly we ask that you read this style guide to understand how to put together a guide. The purpose of this style guide is to outline an approach that maintains clarity and consistency in how different authors approach writing content for IndieWeb Guides.**

## Content structure and presentation
Each guide starts with an excerpt consisting of no more than **100 words**. This is displayed in three places: the A-Z navigation structure, styled in bold beneath the page title and in the page description used by search engines.

For the main body of content make balanced use of headings, concise lists and paragraphs which help structure the guide into different steps and sections.

Each guide needs to be tagged and added to the ***tags*** property as a ***guide***. A one-word title should be added to the ***secondary_tag*** property written in lower caps, using underscores to separate words. Decide which of the overall [categories](/guides/) and sub categories your guide is relevant to and add this name into both the ***tag*** and ***primary_tag*** properties so it's displayed in the A-Z navigation list.

## Writing for the right audience
Please be aware that the intended audience for IndieWeb Guides is ***not*** assumed to be highly technical or experienced in any way with terminology, acronyms and concepts relating to website development, computer science or technologies.

You may struggle at first to write in a suitable style for this audience. Overtime it will help you to understand the topic you're writing about better if you consider different ways to explain and break it down into more digestible sections and paragraphs.
