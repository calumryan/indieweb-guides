## 1. Overview
Jekyll has become quite a popular solution for managing blogs and other types of website without the overhead costs, update requirments and complications of managing a database.

## 2. Getting started with Jekyll
First of all consider the type of hosting you will use for a Jekyll-based website.

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) provides a quick-start setup to handling the hosting of a Jekyll-based site.

It's helpful to have a setup that incorporates ready-made templates with features like [Microformats](/browse/microformats/).

- [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) is a Jekyll theme incorporating some simple Microformat features to get you started.
