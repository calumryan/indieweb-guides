## 1. Overview
The way you decide to write, design and structure content for your website has important implications for how many different individuals can access and engage with your website. Considering accessibility shouldn't be an after thoughts but be at the forefront of planning over all aspects of creating your website.

## 2. Accessible content
Importantly layout the contents of you page so as not to overwhelm users by making good use of HTML elements like paragraph tags and lists. This lessens the chance of problems such as cognitive overload and helps users keep track of where they are in the page even if they're distracted or consumed by other tasks.

## 3. Accessible images and videos
When adding images to your website describe what is in your images such as where they've been taken and who or what is in them so users with vision impairment, or other disabilities can still understand they contain. If your website is using a [CMS](/browse/cms) then you'll likely have an option to add this in. If you're writing the code for your website then check that you have included and filled in the `alt` attribute on images.

Videos need to be accessible too in a variety of ways including:

- **Captions/subtitles**
- **An audio description track**
- **Alternatives**

## 4. Tools to check for accessibility
- **AXE** Accessibility testing for Chrome and Firefox developer tools
- **WAVE** Web accessibility evaluation tool overlays your website
- **Contrast checker** Check your website's colour scheme passes WCAG guidelines
