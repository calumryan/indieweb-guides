## 1. Overview
Netlify can connect to a git repository of your choosing and deploy it with features including continuous deployment, DNS management and SSL support. It's a suitable choice for anyone looking to setup a low-maintenance static generated website without concerns of cost, security vulnerabilities and maintenance of a server-side based CMS website like WordPress, SquareSpace or Drupal.

## 2. Repositories
Prior to connecting your website for deployment on Netlify you should have it setup on a Git-based repository to allow for continuous deployment. [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) offer different options for free and premium-based hosting of your static generated website.
