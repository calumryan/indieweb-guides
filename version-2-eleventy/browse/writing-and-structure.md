The range and depth of content we publish on the Web is ever increasing but with this comes an immense task to interpret, categorise and present it all and an organised, digestible form that can be universally understood by other humans and computers.

An term frequently spoken about in the IndieWeb community is Microformats. Simply put this is a collective term for a range of formats used in code to structure the content you publish in a way that can be easily interpreted by other computers, search engines and data dependent systems.

Pretty much any kind of content could include Microformats:

- Articles/blog posts (content, published date, category, author, photos)
- Events (content, location, start and finish date)
- Checkins (location, date, friends, photos)

## Get started
Depending on what publishing platform you have Microformats might be setup already.

### Wordpress
If you use WordPress then you'll likely have at least some of your content correctly structured however it may not include Microformats. Install the [IndieWeb plugin](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/) and follow the setup guide for how to setup.

### Drupal
TBC...

### Custom build
Building your website from scratch? In that case consult the [Microformats Wiki](http://microformats.org/wiki/Main_Page) on how to structure your content.
