## 1. Overview
Drupal is an open-source CMS with a large community of users and developers furthering its development and supporting new features.

## 2. Drupal and the IndieWeb
There's a feature packed [Drupal module for IndieWeb](https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb) which ties in with services including Webmention.io and Bridgy. This way the module facilitates the display of, sending and receiving [Webmentions](/browse/webmentions-details/#implementation) such as for commenting on posts,replies and rsvps. It has features to allow other to login through the website and create content via [Micropub](/browse/micropub-details/). Content is created in [Microformats](/browse/microformats/)
