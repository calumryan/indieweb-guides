Domain registrars handle the reservation of domain names and assignment of an associated IP address but do not themselves manage domain names. A separate organisation known as a domain name registry undertakes this management. Depending where you reside and the purposes of your website then you may have a greater or more limited choice of top-level domains (TLD) which you can buy.

## After registering a domain name
Once you've purchase a domain name then you need to link this up with some hosting unless your hosting provider and purchased package includes domain registration. If you haven't already got [hosting] and unclear about this then consider looking into [self hosting](/browse/self-hosting) or [shared/managed hosting](/browse/shared-hosting).

Your domain registrar should provide a section in your account settings to specify the details of your hosting knows as DNS settings. This includes a group of records which you should be able to obtain from your host to specify the numerical address for your domain to point to.
