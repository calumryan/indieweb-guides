## 1. Overview
Having a personal domain is one of the first steps in owning and controlling your identity on the Web to uniquely identifying who you are. Sharing and remembering your personal domain should be alot easier than a list of social media profiles which you can’t guarantee will last or be accessible to everyone now or in the future.

Many decide to use their personal domain to function as a central hub collating together things like their LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook profiles. Linking back and forth with your profiles and personal domains means that whatever the lack of interconnectivity between different social media you can still link back to your personal domain.
