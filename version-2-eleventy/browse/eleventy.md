## 1. Overview
Like other static site generators the learning curve for Eleventy assumes prior experience of writing HTML. You can get started building a site with Eleventy either from scratch or using an example.

## 2. Eleventy and the IndieWeb
There's a choice depending on you abilities and experience for putting together a website with Eleventy.

- [Max Böck](https://mxb.dev/) developed his website using Eleventy which is built in-line with the principles of the IndieWeb. Take a look the code for his website on [GitHub](https://github.com/maxboeck/mxb).
- [Phil Hawksworth](https://www.hawksworx.com/speaking) developed this lightweight starter build for Eleventy. If you're looking to learn about IndieWeb principles first, and then add them to your website afterwards, then you might find this [scaffold](https://www.hawksworx.com/speaking) more suitable.
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) if you're building your website from scratch or looking to move over from an existing website then download or clone the Eleventy build from [GitHub](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/)

## 3. Syndicating content with Eleventy
If you're looking to reach a wider audience from your Eleventy site and interact with users on platforms like Twitter then there are some ways to achieve this without need your own server-side technologies.

Max Böck has put together an article on doing eactly this on [Static Indieweb pt1: Syndicating Content](https://mxb.dev/blog/syndicating-content-to-twitter-with-netlify-functions/) using Netlify as his host. Netlify is one of a few hosting options for Eleventy, and other static generated websites, to offer triggers for everytime you post something or want to pull in responses to your posts.
