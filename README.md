# Introducing the IndieWeb
## Clear, simple guides to taking greater control of your data on the Web

Source code for Introducing the IndieWeb guides. This is a work in progress started at IndieWebCamp Nuremburg which is a documentation of what the IndieWeb community is about written for and aimed at non-technical users. It's **not** a replacement for the Wiki [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org/) which is a more in-depth technical documentation of principles, tools and standards set out and authored by the IndieWeb community.

Feel free to send a pull request to make edits/additions. Anyone who actively contributes to the community, has attended at least one IndieWebCamp or Homebrew Website Club should contact me directly through [IRC](https://chat.indieweb.org), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/calum_ryan) or [email](mailto:hello@calumryan.com) to become a main contributor to the guides.
