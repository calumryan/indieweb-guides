This is a work in progress started at IndieWebCamp Nuremburg 2017. It's a documentation of what the IndieWeb community is about written for and aimed at non-technical users. It's **not** a replacement for the Wiki [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org/) which is a more in-depth technical documentation of principles, tools and standards set out and authored by the IndieWeb community.

Feel free to send a pull request to make edits/additions. Anyone who actively contributes to the community, has attended at least one IndieWebCamp or Homebrew Website Club should contact me directly through IRC, Twitter or email to become a main contributor to the guides.
